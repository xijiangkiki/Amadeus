"""One assessment, one narration: the character stops signing off on claims.

2026-07-31, session 20260731-191318: every tool call in a Locus run was denied,
nothing was written to disk, and the process still exited 0. Two verdicts were
computed from that. The ledger cross-checked the recorded tool failures against
an empty git delta and wrote attention=conflict with the rationale "The process
exited successfully, but recorded facts conflict." The adapter mapped the exit
code to "done". The pill head showed the first; the Report panel and the spoken
report carried the second, so Kurisu told the user the chess game was finished
and saved to the Desktop.

The honest sentence already existed. What was missing was that it owned the
telling.
