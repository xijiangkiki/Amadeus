"""Retrieval replacing injection: finding the task the user meant.

Two facts set this up. The roster carries at most five rows sharing one budget
with the persona, and with candidate rows off by default it carries no task
identifiers at all -- so the main chat has never had a way to name past work.
And `intent="report"` only ever refused to start work: the log line claiming it
answered from the ledger was aspiration, since nothing read the ledger.

The tempting fix -- keep a few recent tasks injected and let the model say when
the one being asked about is missing -- was measured on 2026-08-02 and does not
hold: 3 times in 9 the model answered about the closest task in the list
instead, once inventing one outright. So absence is never the model's judgement
to make. The host sees the user's words first, and resolves before the model
speaks; by the time the model answers, the right task is simply present.

Runs standalone through tools/run_tests.py and is also pytest-compatible.
