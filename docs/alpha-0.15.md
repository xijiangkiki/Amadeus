# 0.15 Alpha: routing authority and continuous interaction

Status: draft integration candidate, not a published release.

This candidate keeps the foreground character conversation responsive while Work
owns requested deliverables, execution identity, accepted requirements, and results.
Interaction contexts provide addressing and continuation through the existing
Provider runtime. They do not become a second writable task system.

## 0.15 Alpha acceptance constraints

All three constraints must hold together:

1. **Accurate intent routing:** correctly interpret the requested action, source and
   target across ordinary Chat, Provider messages, Work changes and application actions.
2. **Efficient Provider interaction:** preserve the correct native context and Work
   identity. Ordinary questions do not create extra requirements or execution attempts;
   replay does not duplicate execution.
3. **Low-latency character response:** professional planning must preserve a fast
   initial character reply. The warm ordinary-Chat gate is ≤1.5 seconds from typed
   request submission to the first audio-device write, excluding cold startup. The
   opening response can begin before planning completes.

Accuracy gains must preserve Provider continuity and character responsiveness.
Historical routing scores, interaction-contract tests and physical voice samples
provide distinct evidence; no one category alone establishes release readiness.

## Routing and ownership

- Main Chat interprets the user and can stream its first spoken response before a
  professional Work decision finishes. Acknowledgement is not execution acceptance.
- The optional professional planner interprets new work, amendments, reports,
  cancellations, and messages using the original request and frozen shared history.
- The Host rechecks source, identity, target, permissions, and current execution state
  before shared Work admission. Accepted requirements and ordinary questions remain
  distinct: questions do not create another requirement or execution attempt.
- Interaction contexts preserve a conversation address and compatible native session.
  Work, Project, Draft, Attempt, and Provider session identities remain separate.
- New unplaced deliverables remain Drafts until explicit Project creation/promotion.
- AUIP owns application actions and receipts. A capability-blocked application request
  remains an application refusal and cannot be redirected to an unrelated task.
- Ambiguous App/Work stops do not authorize either stop. Independent requests retain
  their own handling. Speech interruption is separate from Work cancellation.
- Missing or untrusted selected directories block execution at their owning boundary;
  they do not disable ordinary Chat or an independently placed new Draft.

## Configuration

The [three-strategy comparison and accuracy baseline](routing-accuracy-baseline.md)
explains original Chat, cooperative basic, and professional cooperative separately.
The historical same-model comparison scored 17/26, 21/26, and 23/26 respectively;
it is distinct from deterministic contract tests and current-candidate acceptance.

The following explicitly selects the professional route used in the acceptance sample:

```dotenv
COOPERATIVE_CHAT_ENABLED=true
COOPERATIVE_WORK_PLANNER_ENABLED=true
```

The planner uses the selected Main Chat model transport. An optional
`COOPERATIVE_WORK_PLANNER_MODEL` overrides only the planner model. A role model is
independent from the Provider that executes a task.

Both cooperative routing and the professional planner default on in 0.15 Alpha.
These are startup selectors; changing them requires a backend restart:

| Cooperative | Professional planner | Active route |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `true` | `true` | Professional cooperative (default) |
| `true` | `false` | Basic cooperative |
| `false` | either | Original Chat authority; cooperative and planner are not installed |

To restore the established public-main routing behavior, set
`COOPERATIVE_CHAT_ENABLED=false` and restart. The existing
`CONTROL_DECISION_AUTHORITY_ENABLED=true` and
`COMPOUND_CONTROL_AUTHORITY_ENABLED=true` defaults retain the original authority
path; preserve any deliberate pre-existing overrides of those original flags.
This selects the original implementation over shared execution and presentation
facilities. It does not run both routes or silently retry a failed professional
decision through the original route. The basic
cooperative route still has a known explicit-Provider-constraint limitation; the
professional acceptance result does not establish parity for that configuration.

## Other integrated surfaces

The routing branch includes bounded AUIP after-Work entry and authoring validation/recovery
and the associated artifact appearance preference. Experimental, opt-in ACP v1 agents, complete-file
review for truncated Slice export previews, and the compact VN-style companion panel
are separate Draft PRs within the same 0.15 Alpha release scope.
The public mainline's uv installation profiles, Linux AEC source build, macOS wallpaper
lifecycle, keyboard chat entry, and optional character retrieval remain in place.
See [installation profiles](install_profiles.md). The standalone companion is reviewed
in [PR #75](https://github.com/Code-Amadeus/Amadeus/pull/75);
[ACP #76](https://github.com/Code-Amadeus/Amadeus/pull/76) and
[Slice export review #77](https://github.com/Code-Amadeus/Amadeus/pull/77)
are stacked on the routing candidate because they consume its shared Host contracts.
ACP's Claude/dsh examples are local integration probes, with no real production use.

## Voice acceptance evidence

**Result: both measured warm ordinary-chat samples passed the ≤1.5-second E2E first-audio acceptance gate with cooperative routing and the professional planner enabled.** The second sample followed a completed planner task. Cold startup and task-response latency were recorded separately and are outside this warm-chat gate.

| Test case | Measured E2E first audio | Acceptance criterion | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Warm ordinary character conversation | **1.125 s** | First audio-device write within 1.5 seconds | Passed |
| Ordinary conversation after a professional-planner task | **1.078 s** | First audio-device write within 1.5 seconds | Passed |

**Test setup (2026-09-14):** `.venv_cu124`, Python 3.12.10, real `server.app` and ChatPage, DeepSeek role model, local GPT-SoVITS **Japanese speech**, and the default Realtek audio output. Both routing flags were enabled. Normal runtime warmup and the short-opening audio cache remained enabled, matching daily use. The semantic model, TTS, playback and Provider paths were not replaced with mocks.

**E2E measurement:** typed-request submission through the first successful non-empty PortAudio write to the audio device, correlated by the same turn/sentence identity. This includes the model request, network communication, first-sentence generation and playback path. It measures delivery to the audio device, not microphone/ASR latency or acoustic loopback.

**Network context and responsiveness:** the test was initiated from **New Zealand**, calling the DeepSeek service in **mainland China**, so first-audio latency includes that cross-border communication. With lower communication latency, **warm E2E first audio may fall below one second**. With professional routing enabled, the character's first spoken response can begin without waiting for professional planning to complete.

A separate comparison used AWS Bedrock in Sydney (`ap-southeast-2`) with Qwen3-235B. It showed variability across warm turns and used a different model, so it is supporting context rather than a network-only A/B test or an all-turn pass claim. Individual timings remain in the local measurement record.

These are two physical warm-chat samples collected in the integration workspace, not a long-run percentile guarantee or a new physical measurement of every later public commit. Network transit and model-service time were not isolated, and the result does not claim zero planner overhead. Deterministic regression and build checks are reported separately.

## Draft boundaries

After-Work automatic entry retains in-process continuation limits. This candidate
does not promise restart persistence for every pending application launch, arbitrary
cross-Provider batches, or exhaustive natural-language routing accuracy. Microphone,
ASR/Wake, packaged platform UI, long-running device behavior, and clean full CI are
separate evidence from the warm typed-Chat sample.

Only current runtime contract tests and their required helpers are added here.
Internal chronological journals, hash-frozen experiment campaigns, recorded sessions,
model weights, personal paths, and unrelated local demonstration assets are not part
of this public delta.

Further structural simplification should follow a demonstrated duplicate owner or
unused live path. This draft does not retire a working routing strategy solely to
reduce line count. Merge cleanup should concentrate on integration defects, public
documentation, and green candidate checks.
