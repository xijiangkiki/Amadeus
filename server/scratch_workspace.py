"""Where work that belongs to no known project goes.

An instruction like "build me a chess game" names no project, and until now the
host inferred a destination for it: the intake fell through to ``Path.cwd()``,
which is the server's launch directory, which is the user's own repository. The
quarantined artifacts under ``.tmp/provider_artifacts/`` are what that looked
like after the fact.

This module gives that work a real destination instead of a guessed one. The
scratch root is a container, not a repository; each such task gets its **own**
git repository underneath it. Per-task repositories cost almost nothing and buy
two things: tasks cannot overwrite each other, and promoting one to a real
project later is just registering the directory that already exists -- no
worktree has to be carved out of another worktree.

See docs/work_destination_work_order.md.
