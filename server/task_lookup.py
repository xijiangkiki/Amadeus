"""Task lookup: the host resolves which past task the user means, by retrieval.

Order is the design (task_lookup_work_order.md section 3.0). The model speaks
before the host sees any tag, so a model asked to notice that a task is absent
from its list answers about the closest present one instead — measured 3 wrong
in 9, once inventing a task that never existed. The host, however, sees the
user's words BEFORE the model does, so absence never has to be judged: resolve
first, then hand the model a context in which the referenced task is simply
present.

Three rungs, each cheaper than the next:

  1. A unique spoken filename is answered from the artifact/title index —
     deterministic, zero model involvement, unbounded by any recency window.
  2. When that misses or ties, a literal-overlap prefilter (recall-tuned, no
     tokeniser) collects candidates and one side-channel call picks among
     them. Picking from a short list is classification, the shape that has
     worked (probe: 12/12 over 8 deliberately similar candidates, ~1s);
     transcription is the shape that has not (workspace_ref, 0/28).
  3. Still unsure means asking the user, in task titles, never ids.

The side channel never speaks, never enters history, and never touches turn
identity — the same discipline as the resend channel it is modelled on.
Everything here is inert unless ``TASK_LOOKUP_ENABLED`` is on (single switch,
rule R7; it retires when the work order's acceptance holds).
