"""Provider-neutral session attachment at the WorkItem boundary.

Provider adapters may return an opaque :class:`ProviderSessionHandle`, but an
intake caller never owns the authority to attach it.  The durable predecessor,
the selected Provider, and the Provider's declared resume capability must all
agree before the handle can leave the ledger and enter a new run request.

Keeping this rule pure and independent from ``WorkLedgerCoordinator`` makes
the ownership boundary reviewable without creating a second source of truth.

    Absence is normal when the operation is new, the Provider does not declare
    ``resume=attach``, the predecessor belongs to another Provider, or the
    predecessor did not produce a work-item-scoped session.  A malformed or
    cross-Provider stored handle is a durable-state conflict and fails closed.

    Dialogue-source scope is intentionally not an attachment key. It protects
    parent-context delta provenance, while native Provider continuity remains
    WorkItem-scoped; a cross-source amendment therefore reuses this session
    but receives a bounded snapshot rather than a cross-source delta.

    Retry attachment preserves the established progress-only path. An AUIP
    validation retry additionally requires the Host-validated typed recovery
    whose predecessor is exactly this durable Attempt; a reason string alone
    cannot authorize native continuity.
