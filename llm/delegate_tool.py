"""The delegate contract as a schema instead of as prose.

DELEGATE has always been a tool call in everything but transport: the model
states a structured intent, the host executes it, the result comes back. It
was expressed as an inline tag parsed out of the text stream, which meant
every constraint a schema would enforce for free — provider is required,
provider is registered, and either a text task or structured operation must
be complete — could only be asked for in sentences, and asking is not
enforcing. On 2026-07-31 that gap accounted for the entire class of failures
under investigation.

The schema below is deliberately the same vocabulary the tag already used, so
the host side downstream of `record_actions` is unchanged and the two
transports remain interchangeable behind `LLM_DELEGATE_TOOL_CALLS`.

Measured later that same day, swapping the transport lost. Native tool calls
took the read-only violation rate to 58% where the tag sat at 20% -- tool
calling is a post-trained reflex, and that reflex does not know this system's
read-only invariant -- while a turn-terminating call also couples how long the
character speaks to whether the work dispatches at all. The win came from
applying schema where the constraint actually is: a required `intent`
attribute, which took that same step to 8/8 clean. So the flag above is a
reproducible comparison, not a rollout awaiting its flip; read
docs/archive/delegate_transport_toolcall_probe_2026-07-31.md before changing it.
